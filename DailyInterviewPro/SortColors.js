/**
 * This problem was recently asked by Apple. 
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place 
 * so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
 * 
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
 * Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem. Can you do this in a single pass?
 * 
 * Example: 
 * 			Input: 	[2,0,2,1,1,0]
 * 			Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

/**
 * This problem was recently asked by Amazon
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, 
 * find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. 
 * If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 		Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
 * 		Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
